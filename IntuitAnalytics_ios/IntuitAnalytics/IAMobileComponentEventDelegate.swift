    Whenever Mobile Component libraries generate events, applications that integrate these mobile
    components will be able to access/modify these events through this listener.  The

    event.  You will have access to the contents of the Mobile Component event.  In addition, you
    will be given the opportunity to append your own information to this event by returning a dictionary
    of event properties from `mobileComponentEventPosted(eventName:eventDictionary:topic:)`.
